          <p>Embryo is a forum for on-line, live and interactive lectures, run by students and faculties of BITS-Pilani. It was conceived and initiated by a group of 6 BITS Pilani Alumni in the Silicon Valley in 2006 with an aim to transform classroom education. Since February, 2006, more than 200 lectures have been successfully conducted in areas as wide ranging as Entrepreneurship, Black Holes, Solar Cells, Science of Smell, Naxalism, Rain water harvesting,Storage Networks, PSOCs, Process Control. In August 2010, Embryo 2.0 was launched. Since then we have conducted a series of lectures. The lecturer works closely with the course faculty and in a few cases, the lecture content is subject to evaluative components. The knowledge of the alumni has thus become an integral part of the BITS curriculum.</p>
          <h2 class="about__content-title">vision</h2>
          <p>Enrich the learning experience at BITS Pilani.</p>
          <h2 class="about__content-title">MISSION</h2>
          <p>To make the academic and industrial experience of the BITS alumni accessible to on-campus students through lectures, collaborative research projects, and exposure to current research trends around the world.</p>
          <h2 class="about__content-title">WHY EMBRYO?</h2>
          <p>Although there is no alternative to 'in person' classroom teaching, any University in the world is limited by its on-campus human resources and available expertise. Often, a lecture or two in the right area by the right person can change the course of one's career. Embryo proposes to free education from the barriers of distance, time and human resources. Leveraging web-based technologies, Embryo acts as a bridge between the knowledge seekers (students), and the potential speakers. Such a powerful method truly realizes the dream of border less classrooms and bottomless learning resources.</p>
          <h2 class="about__content-title">AVAILABLE INFRASTRUCTURE</h2>
          <p>With the advent of BITS Connect2.0 , we now have state of the art telepresence solutions across all campuses thus making the experience even richer.</p>
